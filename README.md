# About
The Doc Template repo contains documentation templates open for community use and contribution. Please update the templates to make them more broadly useful across different kinds of projects and to address additional documentation concerns. 

Erin Grace is the owner/maintainer of this repo. If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions, leave a comment or contact me at [erin.rtfm@gmail.com](mailto:erin.rtfm@gmail.com).

# Use the Templates
Feel free to use [the template](https://github.com/erin-rtfm/doc-templates/blob/master/Template%20-%20README:%20Documentation%20Development.md) on your own project to help documentarians who want to contribute to it. There are instructions within the template to help you customize it to your project. 

Make sure you retain the license at the bottom of the template.

# Contribute to the Templates Project
You don't need permission to clone the Doc Template repo. Pull it down, take a look at it, [fork](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project#_forking_projects), and so on as you wish. 

If you want to add or edit templates, create or update the necessary files and submit a [pull request](#pullrequests). You also don't need permission to submit a pull request.

## Location and Format
You can [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) any files in the repo. __Limit edits on the main Readme to grammar, spelling, and punctuation updates.__

If you want to submit a template, use Markdown. To create a Markdown file, save a text file with the .md extension and submit a pull request to add it to the repo. Alternatively, click _Create new file_ on the main repo page (to the left of the green _Clone or download_ button). Use [Git's cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to learn more about Markdown formatting. To test drive your syntax, use the [Dillinger editor](https://dillinger.io/).

## Style Guide
### Primary Style Guide and Tweaks
This project uses [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/) for mechanics, with a few tweaks:

__DO:__
- Use Oxford commas
- Use imperative mood for instructions
- Use a casual, informative tone

__AVOID:__
- "Please" and other requesting or pleading language
- Passive voice

### Supplementary Style Guide
Additionally, for identity language and concerns, this project uses the [Responsible Communication Style Guide](https://rcstyleguide.com/) as a supplement. If you can't access the RCGS, the most important takeaway is to be careful of how you use language related to identity. For example:

| Language type | Example restrictions | Example replacements |
| --- | ---| ---|
| Abelist | Turn a blind eye | Ignore |
| Abelist | "Tone-deaf" as a metaphor | Insensitive | 
| Ageist | "So easy even your grandma can do it" | Easy for inexperienced users |
| Ageist | Digital native | Digital savvy |
| Appropriative | Tribe | Friends, compatriots |
| Appropriative | OG | Original |
| Gendered | "Universal" he/him | They/them |
| Gendered | Male/female connectors | Plug/socket, cord/port |
| Racially charged | Master/slave | Primary/replica |
| Racially charged | Whitelist/blacklist | Allow list/Block list |
| Religious | Witch hunt | Persecution |
| Religious | Heresy/blasphemy | Unorthodox/irreverence | 

## Commit Messages
When you [commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Committing-Your-Changes) changes, Git asks for a commit message. The commit message lets other developers, documentarians, and Future You quickly get a sense of what changes you added to the project in that commit.

The commit message consists of a short description and a longer summary of changes. In the short description, use no more than 50 characters. In the summary, go into more detail about the changes you made. Bearing in mind that the audience is other developers, documentarians, and Future You, go into as much detail as you need to make changes clear. Alternatively, if the changes you made were very small and self-explanatory (e.g., corrected spelling errors, changed an H2 to an H1), you can submit with a description only.

## Pull Requests
A pull request is your request for the Doc Template repo to pull your changes in. You don't need permission to make a pull request. After you submit your pull request, Erin reviews your changes. 

During a review, I looks at your changes and confirm they're appropriate for the project and match the commit messages you submitted. After I'm done with the review, I'll do one of three things:

1. **Accept all changes without comment.** This happens when your changes had no issues. _Your contributions will go live immediately._
2. **Accept all changes with comment.** This happens when there are small issues with your changes that don't affect their viability for the project. For example, a few minor spelling errors. You will see comments as a reply to your pull request. _Your contributions will go live immediately._
3. **Comment only.** This happens when there were some issues with your changes that need to be addressed before I can accept the changes. You will see the comment as a reply to your pull request. _Your changes will not go live until you make the requested changes and those additional changes are accepted._
4. **Reject all changes.** This happens when there are big issues with your changes that make them inappropriate for the project. I'll usually leave comments detailing why your changes were rejected. _Your changes will not go live._

# Submit Issues
If you find an issue with the code or documentation that you can't or don't want to address yourself, [submit an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). You can also submit an issue to make a feature or enhancement request.
