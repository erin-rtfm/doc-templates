# About
The Doc Template repo contains documentation templates open for community use and contribution. Please update the templates to make them more broadly useful across different kinds of projects and to address additional documentation concerns. 

# Use the Templates
Feel free to use this template on your own project to help documentarians who want to contribute to it. There are instructions within the template to help you customize it to your project. 

Make sure you retain the license at the bottom of the template.

# Contribute to the Templates Project
You don't need permission to clone the Doc Template repo. Please pull it down, take a look at it, [fork](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project#_forking_projects), and so on as you wish. 

If you want to add or edit templates, create or update the necessary files and submit a [pull request](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project#_creating_a_pull_request). You also don't need permission to submit a pull request.

## Location and Format
You can [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) any files in the repo. __Limit edits on the main Readme to grammar, spelling, and punctuation updates.__

If you want to submit a template, do so using Markdown. To create a Markdown file, save a text file with the .md extension and submit a pull request to add it to the repo. Alternatively, click _Create new file_ on the main repo page (to the left of the green _Clone or download_ button). Use [Git's cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to learn more about Markdown formatting. To test drive your syntax, use the [Dillinger editor](https://dillinger.io/).

## Style Guide
### Primary Style Guide and Tweaks
This project uses [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/) for mechanics, with a few tweaks:

__DO:__
- Use Oxford commas
- Use imperative mood for instructions
- Use a casual, informative tone

__AVOID:__
- "Please" and other requesting or pleading language
- Passive voice

### Supplementary Style Guide
Additionally, for identity language and concerns, this project uses the [Responsible Communication Style Guide](https://rcstyleguide.com/) as a supplement. If you can't access the RCGS, the most important takeaway is to be careful of how you use language related to identity. For example:

| Language type | Example restrictions | Example replacements |
| --- | ---| ---|
| Abelist | Turn a blind eye | Ignore |
| Abelist | "Tone-deaf" as a metaphor | Insensitive | 
| Ageist | "So easy even your grandma can do it" | Easy for inexperienced users |
| Ageist | Digital native | Digital savvy |
| Appropriative | Tribe | Friends, compatriots |
| Appropriative | Kosher | Correct, aboveboard |
| Gendered | "Universal" he/him | They/them |
| Gendered | Male/female connectors | Plug/socket, cord/port |
| Racially charged | Master/slave | Primary/replica |
| Racially charged | Whitelist/blacklist | Allow list/Block list |
| Religious | Witch hunt | Persecution |
| Religious | Heresy/blasphemy | Unorthodox/irreverence |

## Commit Messages
When you [commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Committing-Your-Changes) changes, Git asks for a commit message. The commit message lets other developers, documentarians, and Future You quickly get a sense of what changes you added to the project in that commit.

The commit message consists of a short description and a longer summary of changes. In the short description, use no more than 50 characters. In the summary, go into more detail about the changes you made. Bearing in mind that the audience is other developers, documentarians, and Future You, go into as much detail as you need to make changes clear.
