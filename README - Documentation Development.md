If you want to add documentation or code back into the project, create or update the necessary files and submit a [pull request](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project#_creating_a_pull_request). You also don't need permission to submit a pull request.


## Documentation Location and Format
[Add](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) files to the `folder name` folder. (If you prefer, you can [add files using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/). You can also [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) files already in the folder.

## Style Guide
`If you already have a documentation style guide:` The style guide is [here]`(URL)`.

`If you have a preferred style guide (e.g., AP, Chicago, Microsoft, etc.):` `Project` uses `style guide name` style. You can find more information about it [here]`(style guide URL)`.

`If you don't have a documentation style guide but are planning to build one or one is in the works:` `Project` doesn't have a style guide yet. We're hoping to release the first draft `date`. Feel free to contribue to it then.

`If you don't have a documentation style guide and want help creating it:` `Project` doesn't have a style guide at this time. Feel free to suggest one or create one whole cloth. When you have established it, update this README for future writers.

If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the style, `Choose one: contact the project (and provide an email address), discuss it in a specific location (and provide a link to that location), other action as appropriate to your project`.
