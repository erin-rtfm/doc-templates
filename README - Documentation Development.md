# About This Template
-----READ ME FIRST-----

This Readme template is designed to help prospective technical writers on your project get their bearings and 
begin to contribute. To customize it for your project:

1. Update the sections below. Items you need to customize are marked as code with backticks. Fill in the correct 
information or choose from the provided options. 
2. Discard any sections that don't make sense for your project. 
3. Discard any unused code sections, including this section (About This Template).
4. Post the Readme on your repo. Be sure to use a filename that distinguishes it from the main Readme and calls 
attention to the fact that it is documentation-specific.
```

# About `Project Name`
```
Describe your project in two or three sentences. Talk about what problem the project aims to solve and who the 
typical users are.

For example: 

About HAL9000 
HAL9000 is the aritificial intelligence component of the _Discovery One_ spacecraft. He is designed to maintain 
ship functions, including navigation and life support, as well as to engage the ship's crew with games and 
conversation. Although HAL's primary users are the _Discovery One_ crew, HAL also interacts with and can recieve
orders from Mission Control on Earth.

# Contributing Documentation
You do not need permission to clone the `Project` repo. Please pull it down, take a look at the code, [fork](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project#_forking_projects), and so on as you wish. 

If you want to add documentation or code back into the project, create or update the necessary files and submit a [pull request](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project#_creating_a_pull_request). You also don't need permission to submit a pull request.

## Documentation Location and Format
[Add](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) files to the `folder name` folder. (If you prefer, you can [add files using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/). You can also [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) files already in the folder.

Submit documentation in `Choose one: HTML, Markdown, PDF, other file format`. 

`If your project uses Markdown for documentation:` To create a Markdown file, save a text file with the .md extension. Use [Git's cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to learn more about Markdown formatting. To test dive your syntax, use the [Dillinger editor](https://dillinger.io/).

## Style Guide
`If you already have a documentation style guide:` The style guide is [here]`(URL)`.

`If you have a preferred style guide (e.g., AP, Chicago, Microsoft, etc.):` `Project` uses `style guide name` style. You can find more information about it [here]`(style guide URL)`.

`If you don't have a documentation style guide but are planning to build one or one is in the works:` `Project` doesn't have a style guide yet. We're hoping to release the first draft `date`. Feel free to contribue to it then.

`If you don't have a documentation style guide and want help creating it:` `Project` doesn't have a style guide at this time. Feel free to suggest one or create one whole cloth. When you have established it, update this README for future writers.

`For all projects, regardless of style guide choices:` If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the style, `Choose one: contact the project (and provide an email address), discuss it in a specific location (and provide a link to that location), other action as appropriate to your project`.

## Commit Messages
When you [commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Committing-Your-Changes) changes, Git asks for a commit message. The commit message lets other developers, documentarians, and Future You quickly get a sense of what changes you added to the project in that commit.

The commit message consists of a short description and a longer summary of changes. In the short description, use no more than `#` characters. In the summary, go into more detail about the changes you made. Bearing in mind that the audience is other developers, documentarians, and Future You, go into as much detail as you need to make changes clear. 

`If you have specific standard practices around commit messages on your project, detail them here.`

You can find more commit message best practices [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
